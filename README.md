# ‚ÄúWaterable‚Äù Flower NFTs - Changes Metadata as It Accrues Tokens From a Superfluid Stream

## What is Superfluid

Moving tokens between accounts is usually pretty boring. It's typically done through basic ERC20 transfers. Say I transfer you 100 DAI - this causes my balance to go down by 100 and yours to go up by 100. 

Superfluid's smart contract framework takes this a step forward by introducing a new token standard, called the **Super Token**. 

The Super Token extends the basic ERC20 transfer functionality to include Super Agreements. These Super Agreements give us new and more powerful ways to move tokens on-chain!

The Constant Flow Agreement (CFA) is the most popular Super Agreement and lets us *stream* our Super Tokens. What does streaming even mean?

Streaming refers to the by-the-second movement of tokens between accounts. Imagine Alice is streaming to Bob at a flow rate of 1 DAIx/second. This means that with every passing second, Alice's balance is increasing by 1 DAI and Bob's is decreasing.

## Flower NFTs (non-technical overview)

Interacting with the [Flower NFT Contract](./contracts/Flower.sol) is simple - you start by creating a stream of `acceptedToken` to the Flower contract.

The Flower contract reacts and mints a Flower NFT to your address. As your stream goes on, the metadata of the Flower NFT will graduate images as the amount you've streamed so far into the contract increases. You can increase/decrease your flow rate or delete your stream as you please!

Addresses can only have one Flower NFT at once. If you transfer your Flower to another address (that doesn't already have a Flower), you will have your `acceptedToken` stream automatically cancelled if you haven't already done so. The metadata on the NFT will be unchanged (not reset to the first image) after the transfer.

## Deploy it on Sepolia Testnet üé¨

1. Clone the repo and build with `npm install`
2. Create a `.env` file and fill out the suggested variables from `.env.template`
   - Make sure the wallet you're providing a private key for has some Sepolia ETH in it. This wallet will be receiving the Flower NFT!
3. Deploy WATER ERC20 Token with `npx hardhat run scripts/utils/deployWater.js --network sepolia`
4. Create the SuperToken WATERx from Token WATER using the Superfluid Wrapper Factory.
5. Update WATERx contract address in scripts/deployFlower.js
3. Deploy FLOWER ERC721 Token with `npx hardhat run scripts/deployFlower.js --network sepolia`
5. Update contract addresses in scripts/utils/deployedContracts.js
3. Mint some WATERx Super Tokens with `npx hardhat run scripts/mintSuperWater.js --network sepolia`
4. Stream the WATERx Super Tokens to the Flower contract with `npx hardhat run scripts/streamWater.js --network sepolia`
5. Go to [Opensea's Testnet App](https://testnets.opensea.io/) and search your address.
   - You should see an "Evolving Flower NFT". That's it! You are now watering the NFT. Note down its token ID
6. After 5 minutes, go to [this NFT Viewer](https://www.nftviewer.xyz/), click into the "Smart Contract" page. Then, enter the contract address `npx hardhat verify --network sepolia --constructor-args arguments-flower-sepolia.js 0x015b0C429B9cC32AB8470c3cb3E11AB548cBe996` and your token ID.

You'll see the NFT image has changed to show a more grown up flower! If you wait another 5 minutes, you'll see it grows again.
